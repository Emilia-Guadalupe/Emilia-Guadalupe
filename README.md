Hi! Nice to meet you :smile:

This is my <b>Github profile</b>. Many of my repositories are deployed, so you can see how the projects look in the links added to the README files. I like to try different kinds of projects, so you'll find an <b>e-commerce</b>, <b>some games</b>, <b>a piano</b>, some <b>to do lists</b>, just to name a few of them. 

I'm always eager to learn new things, to make new projects :relaxed:

#### About Me

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b>Node</b> and <b>Express</b>

âš¡ Fun fact: I started to learn to programme after I almost finished my degree in Social Communication, and it was an instant and very welcomed love
